Version 2.0
-----------
_March 6, 2016_

If you're upgrading from EqualsVerifier 1, please see the [migration guide](/equalsverifier/migration1to2).

* ...no longer use EqualsVerifier with Java 6.
* ...no longer use `EqualsVerifier.forExamples`. Use `#forClass` or `#forRelaxedEqualExamples` instead.
* ...no longer use `#debug()` (which didn't do anything, anyway).
* ...expect "all fields should be used" to be the default behaviour. ([Issue 65](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/65))
    * Suppress `Warning.ALL_FIELDS_SHOULD_BE_USED` to revert back to the old behaviour.
    * `#forRelaxedEqualExamples` implicitly suppresses `Warning.ALL_FIELDS_SHOULD_BE_USED`.
    * Suppressing `Warning.IDENTICAL_COPY_FOR_VERSIONED_ENTITY` implicitly suppresses `Warning.ALL_FIELDS_SHOULD_BE_USED`.
    * `#allFieldsShouldBeUsedExcept()` is now removed.
    * Use `#withIgnoredFields()` to disregard specific fields, while expecting all remaining fields to be used in `equals`.
    * Use `#withOnlyTheseFields()` to expect that the given fields are used, and that the remaining fields are not used. ([Issue 128](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/128))
* ...expect EqualsVerifier to fail when `equals` isn't overridden (i.e., inherited directly from `Object`). ([Issue 66](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/66))
    * Suppress `Warning.INHERITED_DIRECTLY_FROM_OBJECT` to revert back to the old behaviour.
* ...refer to the generic contents of containers, such as `List` and `Optional`, in the implementation of `equals` and `hashCode`. ([Issue 84](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/84))
* ...get more useful information from the stack trace if EqualsVerifier fails.
* ...have better compatibility with Java 8. ([Issue 115](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/115))
* ...know that EqualsVerifier's code quality has been improved, as a result of adding CheckStyle and FindBugs, and doing mutation tests with PIT.

* ...verify the consistency of `hashCode` in a stateless object. ([Issue 97](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/97&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Reporter%20Summary))
* ...verify classes where equality is fully defined in a superclass, for example using Apache Commons's [`EqualsBuilder.reflectionEquals`](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.3.2/org/apache/commons/lang3/builder/EqualsBuilder.html#reflectionEquals%28java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object,%20boolean%29). ([Issue 102](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/102))

Version 1.5.1
-------------
_December 5, 2014_

* ...use EqualsVerifier when incompatible versions of ASM and/or CGLib are on the classpath. EqualsVerifier is now shipped as an "uber jar" which contains all its dependencies inside. ([Issue 96](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/96))
* ...use EqualsVerifier with older versions of Google Guava on the classpath. ([Issue 98](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/98))
* ...build EqualsVerifier itself using Maven instead of Ant+Ivy.

Version 1.5
-----------
_August 20, 2014_

* ...use EqualsVerifer in Java 8! Classes containing Java 8 language features are now supported, and prefab values for new Java 8 API classes have been added. ([Issue 92](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/92))
* ...stop adding prefab values for [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) and [Google Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/), because EqualsVerifier now provides them for you. ([Issue 83](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/83))

* ...test classes that have an array field, but that don't declare an `equals` method.
* ...get clearer error messages around abstract delegation. This clarifies especially classes that contain Joda-Time `LocalDate` fields.
* ...stop worrying about adding prefab values for BitSet. ([Issue 86](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/86))

Version 1.3.1
-------------
_June 9, 2013_

* ...read error messages on the [new EqualsVerifier website](http://www.jqno.nl/equalsverifier/errormessages) at [jqno.nl](http://www.jqno.nl/equalsverifier), which matches EqualsVerifier's fully qualified name: `nl.jqno.equalsverifier.EqualsVerifier`.
* ...disregard .debug(), as it is deprecated. Relevant exceptions are now included as a cause in the stack trace.
* ...test "versioned entity" classes where a zero id field indicates that the object is new, by suppressing `Warning.IDENTICAL_COPY_FOR_VERSIONED_ENTITY`. ([Issue 80](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/80))

Version 1.3
-----------
_June 9, 2013_

Please don't use version 1.3; it's a broken release. Use 1.3.1 instead.

Version 1.2
-----------
_March 26, 2013_

* ...get a transitivity error message for classes that use `or` in their equals method. ([Issue 75](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/75); blog post about [the problem](http://www.jqno.nl/post/2013/02/17/reaction-to-cedric-beusts-equals-challenge/) and [the solution](http://www.jqno.nl/post/2013/03/26/on-transitivity))
* ...expect more robustness from EqualsVerifier when the `toString` method of the class under tests throws exceptions.
* ...use single value enums (and hence, singletons) in your classes, even if they don't count for `equals` and `hashCode`. ([Issue 74](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/74))
* ...use `forRelaxedEqualExamples` with classes containing null fields. ([Issue 73](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/73))
* ...run EqualsVerifier's test suite with less chance of false negatives. ([Issue 77](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/77))

Version 1.1.4
-----------
_January 14, 2013_

* ... fork EqualsVerifier on GitHub! EqualsVerifier has moved its code to GitHub. The project frontpage will remain at Google Code.
* ... use EqualsVerifier on a class whose superclasses have no declarations for `equals` and `hashCode`. ([Issue 63](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/63))
* ... get an error when using `#allFieldsShouldBeUsed()` on a class that has fields but no declarations for `equals` and `hashCode` (and hence doesn't use these fields). ([Issue 67](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/67))
* ... get a more informative error message on Abstract Delegation errors: EqualsVerifier now also mentions the name of the abstract method that was called.

Version 1.1.3
-------------
_April 21, 2012_

* ... add static fields to your classes that are tested with `#allFieldsShouldBeUsed()`. EqualsVerifier will no longer complain if these static fields aren't used in your `equals` and `hashCode` methods. ([Issue 57](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/57))
* ... get a complaint from EqualsVerifier when your `equals` method works incorrectly if a field in the class under test is null. ([Issue 59](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/59))

Version 1.1.2
-------------
_March 1, 2012_

* ... stop worrying about EqualsVerifier _recursively_ changing the value of non-final static fields, causing other tests to fail. (Issue 55, [Comment 8](http://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/55#issuecomment-87376895))

Version 1.1.1
-------------
_February 21, 2012_

* ... suppress `Warning.IDENTICAL_COPY` if you want to use reference equality in an overridden `equals` method. ([Issue 56](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/56))

Version 1.1
-----------
_February 11, 2012_

* ... get a warning if you forgot to include a field in your `equals` or `hashCode` method, by calling the `#allFieldsShouldBeUsed()` method on EqualsVerifier. ([Issue 53](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/53))
* ... get an error message if you include a reference-equality check (`this == obj`), followed by an incorrect instanceof check in your `equals` method. EqualsVerifier will now notice if you do an instanceof check for a class other than the one that you are testing. (Issue 55, [Comment 2](http://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/55#issuecomment-87376889))
* ... stop worrying about EqualsVerifier changing the value of non-final static fields, causing other tests to fail. ([Issue 52](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/52) and [Issue 55](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/55))
* ... stop worrying about adding prefab values for `File`, `List`, `Set`, `Map` and `Collection` to avoid unjustified warning. ([Issue 49](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/49) and [Issue 51](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/51))

Version 1.0.2
-------------
_August 14, 2011_

* ... find EqualsVerifier in Maven Central! ([Issue 36](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/36))
* ... get an error message when you forget to include an `instanceof` check or a `getClass()` check in your `equals` method. ([Issue 47](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/47))
* ... use EqualsVerifier on a class whose superclass has abstract declarations for `equals` and `hashCode`. ([Issue 48](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/48))

Version 1.0.1
-------------
_April 17, 2011_

* ... use EqualsVerifier on dynamically generated classes by disabling annotation processing. ([Issue 41](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/41))
* ... use EqualsVerifier on classes that are a subclass of one of the classes from `rt.jar`, which are loaded by the system classloader. ([Issue 43](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/43))
* ... use EqualsVerifier on classes with `float` or `double` fields but no `equals` method. ([Issue 44](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/44))
* ... stop worrying about adding prefab values for `Throwable` and `Exception`, to avoid that pesky recursion warning. ([Issue 45](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/45))

Version 1.0
-----------
_February 23, 2011_

* ... use the following annotations on your classes and fields: EqualsVerifier will know what to do!
    * `@Immutable`: EqualsVerifier will not complain about non-final fields if your class is `@Immutable`. (It doesn't matter in which package the annotation is defined; `javax.annotations.concurrent.Immutable`, `net.jcip.annotations.Immutable` or your own implementation will all work fine.)
    * `@Nonnull`, `@NonNull` and `@NotNull`: EqualsVerifier will not check for potential `NullPointerException`s for any field marked with any of these annotations. (Again: the source package doesn't matter.) This is similar to calling `suppress(Warning.NULL_FIELDS)`, but on a per-field basis, instead of all-or-nothing. ([Issue 28](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/28))
    * `@Entity`: EqualsVerifier will not complain about non-final fields if your class is a JPA Entity. Note that this only works for `javax.persistence.Entity`, not for `Entity` annotations from other packages. ([Issue 37](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/37))
    * `@Transient`: Fields marked with this annotation (again, only from `javax.persistence.Transient`), will be treated the same as fields marked with Java's `transient` modifier; i.e., EqualsVerifier will complain if they are used in the `equals` contract.
* ... see which field throws a potential `NullPointerException`, instead of having to guess which one it was. ([Issue 39](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/39))
* ... be sure that EqualsVerifier doesn't detect recursive data structures where there are none. ([Issue 34](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/34))
* ... stop worrying about adding prefab values for `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger`, to avoid that pesky recursion warning. ([Issue 34](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/34))

Version 0.7
-----------
_November 15, 2010_

* ... test `equals` methods that use a call to `getClass()`, instead of an `instanceof` check, to determine the type of the object passed in, by calling the `#useGetClass()` method on EqualsVerifier.
* ... get a warning when you use a transient field in your `equals` or `hashCode` method. Don't worry; you can suppress this warning too.
* ... stop worrying about adding prefab values for certain Java API classes, like `Date`, `GregorianCalendar`, or `Pattern`, to avoid that pesky recursion warning.
* ... get a link to the [Error messages](/equalsverifier/errormessages) page to get more help, when EqualsVerifier finds an error.
* ... enjoy many javadoc improvements (including the one in [Issue 32](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/32)).
* Also, the back end is almost completely re-written.

Version 0.6.5
-------------
_August 5, 2010_

* ... use EqualsVerifier on classes with fields of a wide variety of Java API types, without getting 'Recursive datastructure' errors all the time. ([Issue 30](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/30))
* ... get a more helpful error message when `equals`, `hashCode` or `toString` throws something other than a `NullPointerException` when one of the fields in `null`. ([Issue 31](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/31))

Version 0.6.4
-------------
_June 13, 2010_

* ... get an appropriate error message when `Arrays.hashCode()` or `Arrays.deepHashCode()` should have been used, instead of a message that a certain field is used in `equals` but not in `hashCode` or the other way around. ([Issue 27](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/27))
* ... get less frequent non-nullity errors on `toString`.

Version 0.6.3
-------------
_May 18, 2010_

* ... test the equals/hashCode contract for classes that don't override `equals` or `hashCode`. ([Issue 23](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/23))
* ... use EqualsVerifier in conjuction with the [EclEmma](http://www.eclemma.org/) code coverage tool. ([Issue 22](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/22))
* ... test classes that contain (indirect) references to non-static inner classes, without getting messages about recursive data structures. ([Issue 21](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/21))

Version 0.6.2
-------------
_February 11, 2010_

* ... use `#withPrefabValues()` for recursive data structure fields in superclasses again. ([Issue 20](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/20))

Version 0.6.1
-------------
_February 6, 2010_

* ... use `#withPrefabValues()` for fields which delegate to abstract methods again. ([Issue 14](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/14))
* ... access the `#verify()` method more quickly using autocompletion in IDEs. (The method `#verbose()` has been renamed to `#debug()`.)

Version 0.6
-----------
_January 30, 2010_

* ... use a more consistent API. `#with(Feature)` is now `#suppress(Warning)`, which feels more Java-y. Former features that were not warnings, are now proper methods on EqualsVerifier: `#verbose()` and `#withRedefinedSuperclass()`.
* ... get better error messages:
    * many messages now span multiple lines for improved readability;
    * hashCodes are printed (where relevant);
    * unexpected exceptions are no longer eaten by EqualsVerifier, so they can be read without calling `#verbose()`;
    * calls to abstract methods from within `equals` and `hashCode`, which cannot be resolved, are now detected and properly reported. ([Issue 14](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/14))
* ... verify classes that contain fields whose `equals` methods might throw `NullPointerException`s. ([Issue 19](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/19))
* ... be sure that EqualsVerifier doesn't detect recursive data structures where there are none. ([Issue 18](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/18))
* ... use fields of type `Class` in your classes. ([Issue 17](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/17))

Version 0.5
-----------
_September 1, 2009_

* ... test classes that contain fields of interface or abstract class types (such as Lists, and other Collection types). ([Issue 12](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/12))
* ... step through the source code in Eclipse after adding the EqualsVerifier jar to your project. ([Issue 11](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/11))

Version 0.4
-----------
_August 29, 2009_

* ... verify equality rules that are more relaxed than simple field-by-field comparison. ([Issue 9](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/9))

Version 0.3
-----------
_August 1, 2009_

* ... use EqualsVerifier without having to call `#withPrefabValues(...)` all the time. ([Issue 7](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/7))

Version 0.2
-----------
_July 3, 2009_

* ... use the _fields are never null_ feature on classes instantiated with `#forClass(Class)`. ([Issue 1](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/1))
* ... check if `Arrays.deepEquals` was used for multidimensional and `Object` arrays. ([Issue 3](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/3))
* ... access optional features through a clean enum instead of through lots of different method calls. ([Issue 4](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/4))
* ... use EqualsVerifier in unit test frameworks other than JUnit 4 ([Issue 5](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/5))
* ... have stacktraces be printed to `System.err`. ([Issue 6](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/6))

Version 0.1
-----------
_June 1, 2009_

* ... use EqualsVerifier!
