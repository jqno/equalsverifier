# Code of Conduct

EqualsVerifier cares about bug-free equality, in Java and in real life. The place where a person happens to be born, the color of their skin, their gender, or the person they love must not affect the way they are treated. If it does, that’s a bug and we want to fix it.

By participating in this project, you agree to:

- Treat everyone fairly and respectfully.
- Be kind, considerate, and inclusive.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Communicate openly and respectfully.

This project is maintained by a single person and I will do my best to resolve any problems in good faith. I also realize this gets tricky if the issue lies with me. Still, if something comes up, please reach out via [the discussions page](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/discussions) or via equalsverifier-report `(at)` jqno `(dot)` nl.

Don’t allow bugs in your equality. 🌈🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏾🌍
