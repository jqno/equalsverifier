==Can I use !EqualsVerifier with Maven?==
Yes! Click [Maven here] for details.

==How do I build !EqualsVerifier?==
First, check out the code. You can open the project in Eclipse, or you can run ANT directly. Note that Java 6 is required to compile the project, although the ANT script will generate Java 5 compatible JAR files.

==I get generics errors while building==
{{{
type parameters of <S>S cannot be determined; no unique maximal instance exists for 
type variable S with upper bounds T,java.lang.Object
}}}

!EqualsVerifier makes heavy use of generics. Sun's Java compiler has a known bug regarding generics. Since I use Eclipse and OpenJDK, which do not exhibit this bug, it's possible I write code that triggers the bug, and the code might not compile. If this happens, please let me know in an issue and I'll fix it.
