#summary Instructions for Maven users.

*NOTE*: From version 1.0.2 onward, `EqualsVerifier` is available from Maven Central. Therefore, I have deprecated this repository. I will keep it around for those who find it useful, but version 1.0.2 will be the last version published here.

If you want to add version 1.0.2 or below of `EqualsVerifier` to your Maven project, add the following to your POM file. Be sure to replace the `???` with the appropriate version!

{{{
  <dependency>
    <groupId>nl.jqno.equalsverifier</groupId>
    <artifactId>equalsverifier</artifactId>
    <version>???</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>

  ...

  <repository>
    <id>equalsverifier-repository</id>
    <url>http://equalsverifier.googlecode.com/svn/maven/</url>
  </repository>
}}}
