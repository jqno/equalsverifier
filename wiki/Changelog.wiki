What's new?

Well, you can now ...

== Version 0.3 ==
  * ... use `EqualsVerifier` without having to call `#withPrefabValues(...)` all the time. ([http://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/issues/detail?id=7 Issue 7])

== Version 0.2 ==
  * ... use the _fields are never null_ feature on classes instantiated with `#forClass(Class)`. ([http://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/issues/detail?id=1&can=1 Issue 1])
  * ... check if `Arrays.deepEquals` was used for multidimensional and `Object` arrays. ([http://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/issues/detail?id=3 Issue 3])
  * ... access optional features through a clean enum instead of through lots of different method calls. ([http://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/issues/detail?id=4 Issue 4])
  * ... use `EqualsVerifier` in unit test frameworks other than JUnit 4 ([http://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/issues/detail?id=5 Issue 5])
