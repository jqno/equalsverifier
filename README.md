**EqualsVerifier** can be used in Java unit tests to verify whether the contract for the equals and hashCode methods in a class is met.
The Maven coordinates are:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>nl.jqno.equalsverifier</groupId>
    <artifactId>equalsverifier</artifactId>
    <version>3.10</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Note that there's also a 'fat' jar with no transitive dependencies with artifactId `equalsverifier-nodep`.

# Documentation

Please see the [project's website](https://www.jqno.nl/equalsverifier).

To generate the website:

* Using Nix: open a `nix-shell` in the `docs/` folder
* Using Jekyll: install the Ruby 3.x toolchain and run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`

# Contribution

Pull requests are welcome! If you plan to open one, please also [register an issue](https://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/issues/list) or [send a message to the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/equalsverifier), so we can discuss it first. It would be a shame to put in a lot of work on something that isn't a good fit for the project. Also, I can help you by giving pointers on where to find certain things.

# Development

## Build

To build EqualsVerifier, you need [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Just call `mvn` from the command-line, without any parameters, and you're done. Alternatively, you can use any IDE with Maven support.

There are several Maven profiles that can be enabled or disabled:

| profile | activation | purpose |
|-|-|-|
| `modules-jdk8` | JDK 8 up to but not including 11 | Build only the modules that are compatible with Java 8 and up. |
| `modules-jdk11` | JDK 11 up to but not including 16 | Build only the modules that are compatible with Java 11 and up. |
| `modules-jdk16` | JDK 16 | Build only the modules that are compatible with Java 16 and up. |
| `modules-jdk17` | JDK 17 and up | Build all modules and build releaseable artifacts. |
| `static-analysis` | JDK 17 and up, _and_ `disableStaticAnalysis` property must be off | Run static analysis checks. This only happens on a recent JDK. Can be disabled by running `mvn verify -DdisableStaticAnalysis` |
| `release-verification` | JDK 17 and up, _and_ `disableReleaseVerification` property must be off | Run release verification checks. This only happens on a recent JDK. Can be disabled by running `mvn verify -DdisableReleaseVerification` |
| `argline-preview` | `preview` property must be on | Enable Java preview features. Can be activated by running `mvn verify -Dpreview` |
| `argline-experimental` | `experimental` property must be on | Enables ByteBuddy experimental features; useful for testing EqualsVerifier on Early Access JDK builds. Can be activated by running `mvn verify -Dexperimental` |
| `pitest` | `pitest` property must be on | Used by PITest integration on GitHub. Can be activated by running `mvn verify -Dpitest` |

## Formatting

EqualsVerifier uses [Prettier-Java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java) through [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to format Java files. You can call it using `mvn` (without any parameters), which will also run the tests and all the other static analysis. Or run `mvn spotless:apply` to only run the formatter.

## Modules

This project is a multi-module project to make it easier to deal with shading and multi-release jar files. See [this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/70541340/127863) for the rationale behind it.

Here's a description of the modules:

| module | purpose |
|-|-|
| docs | project's Jekyll website |
| equalsverifier-core | the actual EqualsVerifier code |
| equalsverifier-11 | tests for Java 11 and up |
| equalsverifier-16 | logic for records, and corresponding tests |
| equalsverifier-17 | logic for sealed classes, and corresponding tests |
| equalsverifier-test-core | tests for the core code |
| equalsverifier-test-plumbing | helpers for tests that are used by multiple projects |
| equalsverifier-aggregator | generic release assembly description, and shared jacoco configuration |
| equalsverifier-release-main | release assembly for jar with dependencies |
| equalsverifier-release-nodep | release assembly for fat jar (with dependencies shaded in) |
| equalsverifier-release-verify | validation tests for the releases |

## Signed JAR

The `lib/` folder in the `equalsverifier-test-core` module contains a local Maven repository containing a signed JAR, used to test potential ClassLoader issues. Here's how to install a JAR into it:

```sh
mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.3.1:install-file \
                        -Dfile=&lt;path-to-file> -DgroupId=&lt;myGroup> \
                        -DartifactId=&lt;myArtifactId> -Dversion=&lt;myVersion> \
                        -Dpackaging=&lt;myPackaging> -DcreateChecksum=true \
                        -DlocalRepositoryPath=equalsverifier-test-core/lib
```

The signed JAR itself can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier-signedjar-test).
