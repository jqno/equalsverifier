## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Support records that don't allow 0 values in their fields, with Warning.ZERO_FIELDS. ([Issue 613](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/613))

## [3.9.1] - 2022-03-19
### Fixed
- Support null checks in record constructors with Warning.NULL_FIELDS. ([Issue 610](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/610))
- Restores javadoc and sources jar files on Maven Central. ([Issue 598](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/598))

### Changed
- Made submodule dependencies in published `pom.xml` optional, so the Maven Enforcer Plugin won't complain. ([Issue 587](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/discussions/587))

## [3.9] - 2022-01-31
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier is now released as a multi-release JAR file, in two variants: `equalsverifier` and `equalsverifier-nodep`. `equalsverifier-nodep` has all its dependencies shaded into a fat jar file; `equalsverifier` has dependencies. Note that until now, `equalsverifier` was the only artifact, and it was a shaded fat jar. ([Issue 575](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/575))

## [3.8.3] - 2022-01-25
### Added
- Support for Jakarta persistence annotations. ([Issue 576](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/576); thanks Ahli!)

### Fixed
- Exception when testing sealed classes that redefine equals. ([Issue 564](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/564#issuecomment-1016495005))

## [3.8.2] - 2022-01-04
### Fixed
- Exception when testing sealed classes that redefine equals. ([Issue 564](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/564))

### Fixed
- Uncaught NullPointerException in certain cases when a used field throws it. ([Issue 552](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/552))

## [3.8] - 2021-12-03
### Added
- `withResetCaches()` to reset the Objenesis caches. This can be useful if the test framework uses multiple class loaders; see for instance [this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/70123578/127863).

### Changed
- Verifies equality for `BigDecimal` using `compareTo()`. ([Issue 540](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/540); thanks ac183!)


## [3.7.2] - 2021-10-15

## [3.5.1] - 2021-01-05
### Changed
- Website is migrated from `gh-pages` branch to `docs` folder to make it more accessible.
- JDK-specific unit tests, such as the `RecordsTest` which targets JDK16+, have now been migrated to `src/test/javaXX` (where `XX` is the version number of the JDK the test targets) so there is no longer a need to compile classes at run-time inside the test.
- Upgraded unit tests to JUnit 5.
- Replaced [Google Fava Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) with [Prettier-Java](https://prettier-java.tech/), which makes the code look less jagged and messy.
- CI is migrated from CircleCI to GitHub Actions.

### Fixed

### Fixed
- Added prefab values for `java.net.URL`. ([Issue 340](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/340))

## [3.4] - 2020-06-13
### Added
- `EqualsVerifier.simple()`, which gives you an EqualsVerifier that's not so strict and will immediately approve an `equals` method generated by your IDE. Under the hood, it suppresses `Warning.STRICT_INHERITANCE` and `Warning.NONFINAL_FIELDS`.
- Initial support for Java 14's records and their [new equality invariant](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Record.html).
- Support for JSR305's `ParametersAreNonnullByDefault` annotation. ([Issue 308](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/308))

### Changed

## [3.3] - 2020-05-14
### Added
- Overload for `#except()` when using `#forPackage()` that takes a predicate instead of a set list of elements. ([Issue 307](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/307); thanks Tom!)
- `#forClasses()` overload that takes an `Iterable<Class<?>>`. ([Issue 271](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/271))


## [3.2] - 2020-05-10
### Added
- Support for testing multiple classes at once, through `#forClasses()` and `#forPackage()`. See the [manual entry](https://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/manual/several-classes-at-once/) for more information. ([Issue 271](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/271))

- EqualsVerifier throws ReflectionException when it's unable to read annotations on fields in certain situations. (Issue 114, [Comment 21](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/114#issuecomment-206463710))


## [2.0.2] - 2016-04-03
### Fixed
- Classes that implement an abstract class that calls an abstract method in its `equals` or `hashCode` method, throws AbstractMethodError. ([Issue 138](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/138))
- `javax.naming.Reference` throws IllegalStateException on certain JVMs. ([Issue 114](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/114))


## [2.0.1] - 2016-03-13
### Changed
- `com.google.code.findbugs.annotations` dependency now has `provided` scope. ([Issue 135](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/135); thanks Stephan!)

### Fixed
- Classes that have a static final reference to a recursive data structure, without adding a prefab value.
- Classes that have a generic parameter that extends `Comparable` throw IllegalArgumentException. ([Issue 136](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/136))


## [2.0] - 2016-03-06
If you're upgrading from EqualsVerifier 1.x, please see the [migration guide](http://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/migration1to2).

### Added
- `#withIgnoredFields()` to disregard specific fields, while expecting all remaining fields to be used in `equals`.
- `#withOnlyTheseFields()` to expect that the given fields are used, and that the remaining fields are not used. ([Issue 128](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/128))
- `Warning.ALL_FIELDS_SHOULD_BE_USED` to suppress Significant field errors.
- EqualsVerifier fails when `equals` isn't overridden (i.e., inherited directly from `Object`). ([Issue 66](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/66))
  - `Warning.INHERITED_DIRECTLY_FROM_OBJECT` to revert back to the old behaviour.

### Changed
- 'All fields should be used' is now the default behaviour. ([Issue 65](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/65))
- `#forRelaxedEqualExamples()` implicitly suppresses `Warning.ALL_FIELDS_SHOULD_BE_USED`.
- Suppressing `Warning.IDENTICAL_COPY_FOR_VERSIONED_ENTITY` implicitly suppresses `Warning.ALL_FIELDS_SHOULD_BE_USED`.
- EqualsVerifier puts more useful information on the stack trace if it fails.
- Replaced internal dependency to CGLib with Byte Buddy, for better support of Java 8. ([Issue 115](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/115))
- Improved EqualsVerifier's code quality by adding Checkstyle and FindBugs, and doing mutation tests with PIT.

### Removed
- Support for Java 6.
- `EqualsVerifier#forExamples()`. Use `#forClass()` or `#forRelaxedEqualExamples()` instead.
- `EqualsVerifier#debug()`. (It didn't do anything anymore, anyway.)

### Fixed
- Referring to the generic contents of containers such as `List` and `Optional` in the implementation of `equals` and `hashCode` can throw ClassCastException. ([Issue 84](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/84))

  - Using FindBugs's `@DefaultAnnotation` or `@DefaultAnnotationForFields`,
  - Using a JSR 305 annotation (see [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/11776302/127863)),
  - Placing them either on the class or on the package,
  - With the ability to override the default annotation by placing `@Nullable` or `@CheckForNull` on a field.
- Check for `hashCode` consistency when object is stateless. ([Issue 97](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/97))
- Support for classes where equality is fully defined in a superclass, for example using Apache Commons's [`EqualsBuilder.reflectionEquals`](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.3.2/org/apache/commons/lang3/builder/EqualsBuilder.html#reflectionEquals%28java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object,%20boolean%29). ([Issue 102](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/102))

### Fixed
- Stateless classes cause Precondition error. ([Issue 46](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/46))
- Classes with stateless fields cause Precondition error. ([Issue 100](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/100) and [Issue 101](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/101)) 


## [1.5.1] - 2014-12-05
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier now build with Maven instead of ANT+Ivy.

### Fixed
- Dependency issues when incompatible versions of ASM and/or CGLib are on the classpath: EqualsVerifier is now shipped as an "uber jar" which contains all its dependencies inside. ([Issue 96](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/96))
- EqualsVerifier throws ReflectionException with older versions of Google Guava on the classpath. ([Issue 98](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/98))


## [1.5] - 2014-08-20
### Added
- Support for Java 8! Classes containing Java 8 language features are now supported, and prefab values for new Java 8 API classes have been added. ([Issue 92](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/92))

### Changed
- Improved error messages when `equals` or `hashCode` are themselves abstract.
- Heavily refactored EqualsVerifier's unit tests to make them easier to find and understand.

### Fixed
- Classes from [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) and [Google Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) throw AbstractMethodError: added prefab values. ([Issue 83](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/83))
- Multi-dimensional arrays cause incorrect error messages. ([Issue 90](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/90) and [Issue 94](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/94))
- `Arrays#equals` on `Object[]` fields doesn't work; only `Arrays#deepEquals()` does. ([Issue 94](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/94))
- Using `#allFieldsShouldBeUsed()` requires overriding `equals`. ([Issue 95](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/95); thanks Dean!)


## [1.4.1] - 2014-03-18
### Changed
- Improved EqualsVerifier's unit tests for reflexivity and symmetry, to catch small mistakes such as the one in [Issue 88](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/88).

### Fixed
- Verifying an enum causes Identical Copy and Symmetry errors. ([Issue 87](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/87))

## [1.4] - 2013-12-27
### Added
- `#allFieldsShouldBeUsedExcept()` to specifically ignore certain fields. ([Issue 82](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/82))

### Changed
- EqualsVerifier now covers 100% of your `equals` and `hashCode` methods. ([FAQ](http://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/faq#coverage))
- Error messages around abstract delegation are clearer. This clarifies especially classes that contain Joda-Time `LocalDate` fields.

### Fixed
- Classes that have an array field but don't declare an `equals` method cause an error.
- `java.util.BitSet` fields cause ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: added prefab value. ([Issue 86](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/86))


## [1.3.1] - 2013-06-09
### Added
- `Warning.IDENTICAL_COPY_FOR_VERSIONED_ENTITY` which can be suppressed when testing "versioned entity" classes where a zero id field indicates that the object is new. ([Issue 80](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/80))

### Changed
- Explanations for EqualsVerifier's error messages can now be read on the [new EqualsVerifier website](http://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/errormessages) at [jqno.nl](http://jqno.nl/equalsverifier), which matches EqualsVerifier's fully qualified name: `nl.jqno.equalsverifier.EqualsVerifier`.
- Transitivity errors are more accurate. ([Issue 78](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/78))

### Fixed
- Exceptions thrown in `#toString()` break EqualsVerifier. ([Issue 79](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/79))
- `java.util.UUID` fields cause Recursion error: added prefab value. ([Issue 81](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/81))

### Deprecated
- `#debug()`, because relevant exceptions are now included as a cause in the stack trace.


## 1.3 - 2013-06-09

Please don't use version 1.3; [it's a broken release](https://jqno.nl/post/2013/06/11/what-happened-to-equalsverifier-1-3/). Use 1.3.1 instead.


## [1.2] - 2013-03-26
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier no longer fails on single value enums (and hence, singletons), even if they don't count for `equals` and `hashCode`. ([Issue 74](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/74))
- EqualsVerifier can now be built using Ant 1.9. ([Issue 76](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/76))
### Fixed
- Non-transitive `equals` methods (using `||`) pass. ([Issue 75](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/75); blog post about [the problem](http://www.jqno.nl/post/2013/02/17/reaction-to-cedric-beusts-equals-challenge/) and [the solution](http://www.jqno.nl/post/2013/03/26/on-transitivity))
- Errors when the `toString` method of the class under test throws exceptions.
- Classes containing null fields throw NullPointerExample in `#forRelaxedEqualExamples`. ([Issue 73](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/73))
- Some false negatives when running EqualsVerifier's test suite. ([Issue 77](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/77))


## [1.1.4] - 2013-01-14
### Changed
- Fork EqualsVerifier on GitHub! The code has been moved to GitHub. The project frontpage will remain on Google Code.
- Error messages on Abstract Delegation are more informative: EqualsVerifier now also mentions the name of the abstract method that was called.

### Fixed
- Issue when the class under test has a superclass that has no declarations for `equals` and `hashCode`. ([Issue 63](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/63))
- No error when using `#allFieldsShouldBeUsed()` and the class under test has fields, but no declarations for `equals` and `hashCode` (and hence doesn't use these fields). ([Issue 67](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/67))


## [1.1.3] - 2012-04-21
### Fixed
- `#allFieldsShouldBeUsed()` includes static fields. EqualsVerifier will now no longer complain if these static fields aren't used in your `equals` and `hashCode` methods. ([Issue 57](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/57))
- EqualsVerifier passes when an `equals` method works incorrectly if a field in the class under test is null. ([Issue 59](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/59))


## [1.1.2] - 2012-03-01
### Fixed
- EqualsVerifier _recursively_ changes the value of non-final static fields, causing other tests to fail. (Issue 55, [Comment 8](http://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/55#issuecomment-87376895))


## [1.1.1] - 2012-02-21
### Added
- `Warning.IDENTICAL_COPY`, to suppress when you want to use reference equality in an overridden `equals` method. ([Issue 56](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/56))


## [1.1] - 2012-02-11
### Added
- `#allFieldsShouldBeUsed()` to get a warning if you forgot to include a field in `equals` or `hashCode` method. ([Issue 53](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/53))

### Fixed
- EqualsVerifier passes when you include a reference-equality check (`this == obj`), followed by an incorrect instanceof check in your `equals` method. EqualsVerifier will now notice if you do an instanceof check for a class other than the one that you are testing. (Issue 55, [Comment 2](http://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/55#issuecomment-87376889))
- EqualsVerifier changes the values of non-final static fields, causing other tests to fail. ([Issue 52](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/52) and [Issue 55](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/55))
- `File`, `List`, `Set`, `Map` and `Collection` fields give unjustified warnings: added prefab values. ([Issue 49](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/49) and [Issue 51](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/51))


## [1.0.2] - 2011-08-14
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier is now in Maven Central! ([Issue 36](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/36))

### Fixed
- EqualsVerifier passes when you forget to include an `instanceof` check or a `getClass()` check in your `equals` method. ([Issue 47](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/47))
- EqualsVerifier throws AbstractMethodError on a class whose superclass has abstract declarations for `equals` and `hashCode`. ([Issue 48](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/48))


## [1.0.1] - 2011-04-17
### Added
- `Warning.ANNOTATION` to disable annotation processing. This is useful for dynamically generated classes. ([Issue 41](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/41))

### Fixed
- Issue when EqualsVerifier tests a class that is a subclass of one of the classes from `rt.jar`, which are loaded by the system classloader. ([Issue 43](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/43))
- EqualsVerifier fails on classes with `float` or `double` fields but no `equals` method. ([Issue 44](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/44))
- `Throwable` and `Exception` fields cause Recursion error: added prefab values. ([Issue 45](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/45))


## [1.0] - 2011-02-23
### Added
- Support for annotations. Use any of the following annotations on your classes and fields: EqualsVerifier will know what to do!
  - `@Immutable`: EqualsVerifier will not complain about non-final fields if your class is `@Immutable`. (It doesn't matter in which package the annotation is defined; `javax.annotations.concurrent.Immutable`, `net.jcip.annotations.Immutable` or your own implementation will all work fine.)
  - `@Nonnull`, `@NonNull` and `@NotNull`: EqualsVerifier will not check for potential `NullPointerException`s for any field marked with any of these annotations. (Again: the source package doesn't matter.) This is similar to calling `#suppress(Warning.NULL_FIELDS)`, but on a per-field basis, instead of all-or-nothing. ([Issue 28](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/28))
  - `@Entity`: EqualsVerifier will not complain about non-final fields if your class is a JPA Entity. Note that this only works for `javax.persistence.Entity`, not for `Entity` annotations from other packages. ([Issue 37](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/37))
  - `@Transient`: Fields marked with this annotation (again, only from `javax.persistence.Transient`), will be treated the same as fields marked with Java's `transient` modifier; i.e., EqualsVerifier will complain if they are used in the `equals` contract.

### Changed
- EqualsVerifier now shows the name of the field that throws a potential NullPointerException. ([Issue 39](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/39))

### Fixed
- EqualsVerifier detects recursive data structures where there are none. ([Issue 34](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/34))
- `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` fields cause Recursion error: added prefab values. ([Issue 34](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/34))


## [0.7] - 2010-11-15
### Added
- `#usingGetClass()` to test `equals` methods that use a call to `getClass()` instead of an `instanceof` check to determine the type of the object passed in.

### Changed
- EqualsVerifier warns when you use a transient field in your `equals` or `hashCode` method. Don't worry, you can suppress this warning too.
- Error messages contain a link to the [Error messages](http://jqno.nl/equalsverifier/errormessages) page to get more help.
- The back end is almost completely re-written.

### Fixed
- Certain Java API classes, like `Date`, `GregorianCalendar` and `Pattern`, cause Recursion error: added prefab values.
- Many Javadoc improvements (including the one in [Issue 32](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/32)).


## [0.6.5] - 2010-08-05
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier now contains an internal list of prefab values for a wide variety of Java API types, to avoid getting 'Recursive datastructure' errors all the time. ([Issue 30](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/30))
- Error messages when `equals`, `hashCode` or `toString` throws something other than a NullPointerException when one of the fields is `null`, are now more helpful. ([Issue 31](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/31))


## [0.6.4] - 2010-06-13
### Fixed
- Error message that a certain field is used in `equals` but not in `hashCode` or the other way around, when really `Arrays.hashCode()` or `Arrays.deepHashCode()` should have been used. ([Issue 27](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/27))
- Many non-nullity errors on `toString`.


## [0.6.3] - 2010-05-18
### Fixed
- EqualsVerifier gives hashCode error on classes that don't override `equals` or `hashCode`. ([Issue 23](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/23))
- IllegalAccessException when EqualsVerifier is used together with the [EclEmma](http://www.eclemma.org/) code coverage tool. ([Issue 22](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/22))
- Classes that contain (indirect) references to non-static inner classes cause recursive data structure errors. ([Issue 21](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/21))


## [0.6.2] - 2010-02-11
### Fixed
- Regression with `#withPrefabValues()` for recursive data structure fields in superclasses. ([Issue 20](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/20))


## [0.6.1] - 2010-02-06
### Changed
- Renamed `#verbose()` to `#debug()` to access `#verify()` more quickly using autocompletion in IDEs.

### Fixed
- Regression with `#withPrefabValues()` for fields which delegate to abstract methods. ([Issue 14](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/14))


## [0.6] - 2010-01-30
### Changed
- The API is more consistent. `#with(Feature)` is now `#suppress(Warning)`, which feels more Java-y. Former features that were not warnings, are now proper methods on `EqualsVerifier`: `#verbose()` and `#withRedefinedSuperclass()`.
- Error messages have been improved:
  - many messages now span multiple lines for improved readability;
  - hashCodes are printed (where relevant);
  - unexpected exceptions are no longer eaten by EqualsVerifier, so they can be read without calling `#verbose()`;
  - calls to abstract methods from within `equals` and `hashCode`, which cannot be resolved, are now detected and properly reported. ([Issue 14](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/14))

### Fixed
- EqualsVerifier fails on classes that contain fields whose `equals` methods might throw NullPointerExceptions. ([Issue 19](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/19))
- EqualsVerifier detects recursive data structures where there are none. ([Issue 18](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/18))
- `Class` fields throw IllegalAccessError: added prefab value. ([Issue 17](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/17))


## [0.5] - 2009-09-01
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier is now compiled with debug information, so you can step through the source in Eclipse after adding the EqualsVerifier jar to your project. ([Issue 11](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/11))

### Fixed
- Fields of interface of abstract class types (such as Lists and other Collection types) throw InstantiationError. ([Issue 12](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/12))


## [0.4] - 2009-08-29
### Added
- `#withRelaxedEqualExamples()` to verify equality rules that are more relaxed than simple field-by-field comparisons. ([Issue 9](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/9))


## [0.3] - 2009-08-01
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier now recursively instantiates objects so `#withPrefabValues()` is now only needed for actual recursive data structures. ([Issue 7](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/7))


## [0.2] - 2009-07-03
### Changed
- EqualsVerifier now checks if `Arrays.deepEquals()` was used for multidimensional and `Object` arrays. ([Issue 3](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/3))
- Optional features are now accessed through a clean enum instead of through lots of different method calls. ([Issue 4](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/4))
- EqualsVerifier can now be used in unit test frameworks other than JUnit 4. ([Issue 5](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/5))
- Stack traces are now printed to `System.err`. ([Issue 6](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/6))

### Fixed
- Can't use the _fields are never null_ feature on classes instantiated with `#forClass()`. ([Issue 1](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/1))


## [0.1] - 2009-06-01
You can now use EqualsVerifier!
