/**
 * {@code EqualsVerifier} can be used in JUnit 4 unit tests to verify whether
 * the contract for the {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods is met. The
 * contracts are described in the Javadoc comments for the
 * {@link java.lang.Object} class.
 * <p>
 * By default, {@link EqualsVerifier} is as strict as possible. However,
 * several methods exist to relax the strictness. 
 * <p>
 * Use, within a JUnit 4 test method, as follows:<br>
 * - Create an instance of {@link EqualsVerifier}. Either call
 * {@link #forExamples(Object, Object, Object...)} to supply at least two
 * instances of the class under test that are not equal to one another, or
 * call {@link #forClass(Class)} to supply a reference to the class itself to
 * let the {@link EqualsVerifier} instantiate objects.<br>
 * - If the class under test is designed for inheritance, and the
 * {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods can be overridden, an instance
 * of the class is not permitted to be equal to an instance of a subclass, even
 * though all the relevant fields are equal. Call
 * {@link #withRedefinedSubclass(Class)} to supply a reference to such a
 * subclass, or call {@link #weakInheritanceCheck()} to disable the check.<br>
 * - Call {@link #allowMutableFields()} to allow mutable fields within
 * {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods.
 * - Call {@link #fieldsAreNeverNull()} if all fields of the class under test
 * are guaranteed never to be null. 
 * - Call {@link #verify()} to perform the actual verifications.
 * <p>
 * Example use:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * EqualsVerifier.forClass(My.class).verify();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * Or, with some of the checks disabled:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * EqualsVerifier.forClass(My.class)
 *     .allowMutableFields()
 *     .fieldsAreNeverNull()
 *     .verify();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The following properties are verified:<br>
 * - Preconditions for {@link EqualsVerifier} itself.<br>
 * - Reflexivity and symmetry of the {@code equals} method.<br>
 * - Symmetry and transitivity of the {@code equals} method within an
 * inheritance hierarchy, when applicable.<br>
 * - Consistency (by repeatedly calling {@code equals}).<br>
 * - "Non-nullity".<br>
 * - That {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code toString} not be able to
 * throw {@link NullPointerException}. (Optional)<br>
 * - The {@code hashCode} contract.<br>
 * - That {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} be defined in terms of
 * the same fields.<br>
 * - Immutability of the fields in terms of which {@code equals} and
 * {@code hashCode} are defined. (Optional)<br>
 * - The finality of the fields in terms of which {@code equals} and
 * {@code hashCode} are defined. (Optional)<br>
 * - Finality of the class under test and of the {@code equals} method
 * itself, when applicable.
 * <p>
 * The last point warrants an explanation. While a class can define a perfect
 * {@code equals} method, a subclass can still break this contract, even
 * for its superclass. Therefore, a class should either be final, or the
 * {@code equals} contract should hold for its subclasses as well. This means
 * that an instance of a class should be equal to an instance of a subclass for
 * which all fields are equal.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, if {@code equals} is overridden, it can break the contract. So
 * either should the {@code equals} method be final, thereby guaranteeing its
 * adherence to the contracts for itself and all its subclasses, or instances
 * of the class may never be equal to instances of the subclass. This should be
 * tested by calling {@link #withRedefinedSubclass(Class)}, and by using the
 * {@link EqualsVerifier} for these subclasses separately as well. For an
 * example of an implementation of such redefined {@code equals} methods,
 * see {@code RedefinablePoint} in the {@link EqualsVerifier}'s unit
 * tests. See Chapter 28 of <i>Programming in Scala</i> (full reference below)
 * for an explanation of how and why this works.
 * <p>
 * By calling {@link #weakInheritanceCheck()}, the latter check can be
 * disabled. A call {@link #withRedefinedSubclass(Class)} is then no longer
 * necessary.
