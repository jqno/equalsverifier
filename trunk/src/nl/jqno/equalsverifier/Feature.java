	 * {@link EqualsVerifier}'s standard behaviour is to disallow non-final
	 * fields being used in {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods, since
	 * classes that depend on non-final fields in these methods cannot reliably
	 * be used in collections.
	 * <p>
	 * However, sometimes an external library requires that fields be
	 * non-final. An example of this are Java Beans. In such a case, this
	 * method can be used to prevent {@link EqualsVerifier} from checking for
	 * non-final fields.

	 * If this is the case, and if the fields cannot be made null later in the
	 * lifecycle of the class by setters or other methods, the
	 * {@code fieldsAreNeverNull} method can be used to disable the check for
