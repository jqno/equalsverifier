# Part two of two stage process for updating PRs with pitest results when accepting PRs from untrusted forks.
#
# The version of this file that runs is the version in the main/master branch, NOT the version in the PR. It must therefore
# be committed to main/master before the process can run for the first time.
#
# This workflow takes an artifact containing pitest results generated in part one, and updated the PR. It runs with
# write access.

        # The updatePR maven goal is used here with an explicit version. This allows us to upload without checking out
        # the code, but does mean the version here must be maintained. An alternative would be to checkout the code and use 
        # the github goal. This will work as long as the artifact is extracted to the maven target directory
